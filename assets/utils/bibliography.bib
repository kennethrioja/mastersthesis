  abstract = {Context Learning analytics is considered as the third wave in educational technology and it is a new and promising field of study. This study was conducted to clarify benefits and challenges of learning analytics in education. Methods Cooper’s systematic literature review was used as the research method. This method has five steps as follows: a) formulation of the problem, b) collection of data, c) evaluation of the appropriateness of the data, d) analysis and interpretation of relevant data, and e) organization and presentation of the results. Based on the study selection process, 36 articles were finally selected to be analyzed. Results The results showed that ethics and privacy were one of the most important challenges of learning analytics in education along with the lack of attention to theoretical foundations and scope and quality of data. The results also showed that learning analytics could bring remarkable benefits for education, such as increased engagement of students, improvement of learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real - time feedback, and personalization of learning. Conclusions Based on the results, it can be concluded that learning analytics offer new insights in education, however, there are ethical, educational, and technical issues in the use of learning analytics in education.}

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

  abstract = {The analysis of data collected from the interaction of users with educational and information technology has attracted much attention as a promising approach for advancing our understanding of the learning process. This promise motivated the emergence of the new research field, learning analytics, and its closely related discipline, educational data mining. This paper first introduces the field of learning analytics and outlines the lessons learned from well-known case studies in the research literature. The paper then identifies the critical topics that require immediate research attention for learning analytics to make a sustainable impact on the research and practice of learning and teaching. The paper concludes by discussing a growing set of issues that if unaddressed, could impede the future maturation of the field. The paper stresses that learning analytics are about learning. As such, the computational aspects of learning analytics must be well integrated within the existing educational research.},

  abstract = {This study examined the extent to which instructional conditions influence the prediction of academic success in nine undergraduate courses offered in a blended learning model (n=4134). The study illustrates the differences in predictive power and significant predictors between course-specific models and generalized predictive models. The results suggest that it is imperative for learning analytics research to account for the diverse ways technology is adopted and applied in course-specific contexts. The differences in technology use, especially those related to whether and how learners use the learning management system, require consideration before the log-data can be merged to create a generalized model for predicting academic success. A lack of attention to instructional conditions can lead to an over or under estimation of the effects of LMS features on students' academic success. These findings have broader implications for institutions seeking generalized and portable models for identifying students at risk of academic failure.},

De même, certains théoriciens contemporains insistent sur la nécessité de considérer le jeu comme un processus mouvant (notamment Malaby), remettant en cause les conceptions essentialistes des phénomènes ludiques. Les travaux de Jacques Henriot sont à la fois précurseurs de ces nouvelles approches mais permettent également de dépasser certains clivages qui se dessinent actuellement autour de ces multiples théories sur la façon dont une situation fait jeu. Ces différentes thématiques étant au coeur de nos propres préoccupations de recherche, nous montrerons en quoi l’apport de Jacques Henriot nous a permis d’élaborer une série de notions (jouabilité, éthos ludique, ludicisation) permettant de penser les mutations des idées du jeu.},

We consider how to associate latent constructs of learning with observable data from a variety of data sources relevant to learning contexts, illustrated with examples from recent LAK proceedings. We also review common sources of errors that arise with a variety of data collection instruments, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for progressing valid and reliable measurement of both learning itself and factors related to the learning process.},

Although the LA space may appear sprawling and complex, there are some clear through-lines that the new student or interested practitioner can use as entry points. Four of these are presented in this chapter, 1. LA as a concern or problem to be solved, 2. LA as an opportunity, 3. LA as field of inquiry and 4. the researchers and practitioners that make up the LA community. These four ways of understanding LA and its associated constructs, technologies, domains and history can hopefully provide a launch pad not only for the other chapters in this handbook but the world of LA in general. A world that, although large, is open to all who hold an interest in data and learning and the complexities that follow from the combination of the two.},

This game deals with the topic of the food system and considers how this concept is integrated with the Swiss school curriculum which constituted the starting point of the game design. Based on the ludicization theoretical framework, we question how learning objectives were articulated with the game elements and the choices made to design a playful learning situation. Our work is grounded on a design-based research methodology. In this context, we describe the initial phase of co-design, which involved co-design activities, research of educational content, and iterative prototyping. This empirical work led to the game AL2049, which aims to bring secondary school students (12–15~years old) to understand interrelationships in food systems and, in so doing, to face complex problem solving. Results comprise the game and the choices made in regard to the ludicization model.},

  abstract = {In computer science, the concept of user experience has proven to be beneficial in order to improve the quality of interaction between software and its users, by taking users’ emotions and attitudes into account. In general, user experience focuses on interaction. As not only interaction (e.g., good usability) is of importance for players, this chapter discusses how the concept of user experience can not only be applied to serious games, but also how it can be extended in order to cover the characteristics of games as a special software. For this refined concept, the term player experience has been coined. First, the concept of player experience is introduced in this chapter. The adequate conceptualization of player experience requires differentiating specific dimensions like (game-) flow, immersion, challenge, tension, competence, and emotions. Because of the individual nature of player experience, psychological models need to be used for the conceptualization as they are able to reflect this multidimensional structure. In addition, interdisciplinary models are needed in order to address the various factors influencing player experience. This ensures a holistic approach. Second, the question how to measure player experience is discussed. Here, different levels have to be distinguished: Behavior, physiological reactions, and subjective experience. Finally, it is shown how knowledge about player experience can be employed to develop serious games systematically and to improve their quality.},
