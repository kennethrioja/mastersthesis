  abstract = {This paper presents the results of the co-design of a learning game in a museum context. This game deals with the topic of the food system and considers how this concept is integrated with the Swiss school curriculum which constituted the starting point of the game design. Based on the ludicization theoretical framework, we question how learning objectives were articulated with the game elements and the choices made to design a playful learning situation. Our work is grounded on a design-based research methodology. In this context, we describe the initial phase of co-design, which involved co-design activities, research of educational content, and iterative prototyping. This empirical work led to the game AL2049, which aims to bring secondary school students (12–15~years old) to understand interrelationships in food systems and, in so doing, to face complex problem solving. Results comprise the game and the choices made in regard to the ludicization model.},
